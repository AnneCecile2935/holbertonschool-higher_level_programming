# JavaScript - DOM Manipulation

## 📚 Description

This project is part of the **Higher Level Programming** curriculum at **Holberton School**.

It introduces JavaScript for manipulating the **Document Object Model (DOM)**: changing content, styles, handling user events, and making network requests via the **Fetch API**.

All tasks are tested in the **Chrome browser** and follow the **semistandard** style guide.

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain:

- How to select HTML elements using JavaScript
- The differences between ID, class, and tag name selectors
- How to change the style of HTML elements
- How to update the content of HTML elements
- How to modify the DOM dynamically
- How to make requests using `XMLHttpRequest` and `Fetch API`
- How to listen and respond to DOM and user events

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- All code runs in Chrome 57+.
- JavaScript code follows **semistandard** style.
- No use of `var`; only `let` and `const`.
- HTML should not reload for any DOM change or API call.

## 🧪 How to Test

Open each *-main.html file in Chrome. Each is linked to a corresponding script (*-script.js) which manipulates the DOM or fetches data.

# Python - Exceptions

## Description
This project covers exceptions in Python. You will learn the difference between errors and exceptions, how to use exceptions, handle them correctly, and when to use them to ensure a clean and efficient program flow.

### Resources
- [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html)
- [Learn to Program 11 Static & Exception Handling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oi7OeRC2vQ) (starting at minute 7)

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Differentiate between errors and exceptions.
- Understand what exceptions are and how to use them.
- Know when to use exceptions.
- Correctly handle an exception.
- Understand the purpose of catching exceptions.
- Raise a built-in exception.
- Implement a clean-up action after an exception.

### Requirements
- Interpreted with **Python 3.8.5** on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**.
- Follow the **pycodestyle (version 2.7.\*)** standard.
- All files must be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- The `README.md` file is mandatory.

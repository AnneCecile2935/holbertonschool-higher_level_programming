# Python - Classes and Objects

## Description

This project is focused on learning the basics of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It covers the creation of classes, defining attributes, using methods, and implementing encapsulation, data abstraction, and property setters/getters. Additionally, it explores how to handle private instance attributes and how to define and use custom classes to model real-world entities.

## Learning Objectives

- What is OOP and how is it implemented in Python
- The difference between a class and an object
- How to define and use attributes and methods
- The purpose of the `__init__` method
- How to define and use property setters and getters
- Implementing comparison methods for custom classes
- Managing private instance attributes

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Python version: 3.8.5
- All files should end with a new line
- Code must pass `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All classes, methods, and functions must have a documentation string

## Project Structure

- **0-square.py** — An empty class `Square` that defines a square.
- **1-square.py** — A class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size`.
- **2-square.py** — A class `Square` with size validation.
- **3-square.py** — A class `Square` with a method to calculate the area.
- **4-square.py** — A class `Square` with getter and setter for `size`.
- **5-square.py** — A class `Square` with a method `my_print()` to print the square.
- **6-square.py** — A class `Square` with position validation and printing using space.

## Task Table

| Task | Description | File |
|------|-------------|------|
| 0    | Create an empty class `Square`. | 0-square.py |
| 1    | Define a class `Square` with a private attribute `size`. | 1-square.py |
| 2    | Add validation for `size` in the class `Square`. | 2-square.py |
| 3    | Implement a method `area()` to calculate the area of the square. | 3-square.py |
| 4    | Add getter and setter for `size` with validation. | 4-square.py |
| 5    | Implement the `my_print()` method to print the square using `#`. | 5-square.py |
| 6    | Add a `position` attribute to `Square` and print the square using space. | 6-square.py |

## Advanced Tasks

| Task | Description | File |

# Python - Hello, World 🐍👋
---

## Description 📚

Welcome to the Python world!

In this project, you will learn fundamental Python programming concepts.
Python offers many ways to accomplish tasks, and here you'll focus on basics like printing text, using strings, indexing, slicing, and adhering to Python's coding style guidelines (PEP8/Pycodestyle).

---

## Author’s Disclaimer ⚠️

You'll soon find that with Python (and most higher-level languages), there are multiple ways to do the same thing. Some tasks expect only one implementation, others allow many.
Python has a linter/style guide called PEP8 (now PyCode), but Holberton starts with a slightly relaxed standard. Don't worry if you get warnings from PEP8.

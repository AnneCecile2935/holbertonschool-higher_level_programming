"""
Lists all State objects and their linked City objects from a MySQL database.

Usage:
    ./101-relationship_states_cities_list.py <mysql_username> <mysql_password>
      <database_name>

This script:
- Connects to a MySQL server on localhost:3306 using SQLAlchemy.
- Uses a single query to fetch all State objects and preloads their cities via
 relationship().
- Displays the results sorted by states.id and cities.id (ascending).
- Prints the data in the following format:

    <state id>: <state name>
        <city id>: <city name>

Note:
    The relationship between State and City must be defined using SQLAlchemy's
    ORM
    with joined loading to avoid N+1 queries. Your State class must have a
    `cities` relationship to City.

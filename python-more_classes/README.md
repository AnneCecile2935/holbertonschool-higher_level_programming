# 🐍 Python - More Classes and Objects

Project completed as part of **Holberton School** curriculum

---

## 📖 Description

This project deepens object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Python by working with more complex classes and objects.
It aims to master class creation, advanced attribute management, inheritance, and method overriding.
